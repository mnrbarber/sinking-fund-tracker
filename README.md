# Sinking Fund Tracker

## Description
I started tracking my sinking funds in notion but found the inability to add recurring scheduled payments that would automatically update my totals annoying plus the effort to track each was just not ideal. This is a simple rails app that allows you to track your sinking funds including one off payments, recurring payments and add expenditure from funds.
